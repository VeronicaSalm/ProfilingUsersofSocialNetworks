1401524178130456577,@megynkelly I agree. It‚Äôs nonsense to wear a mask. A virus can‚Äôt survive in heat! Oxygen deprivation is more if an issue here. Make a mask out if something flimsy &amp; breathable. Solves the issue.

1405560789470269440,"@execulive @NC_Governor Masks do little to protect the wearer unless they are well-fitted N95 masks. Masks protect others by preventing airborne particles/droplets.

The vaccine is highly effective and there are studies and real world data to back that up. Boosters may be needed in the future. So what?"
