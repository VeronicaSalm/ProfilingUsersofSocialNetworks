1412049461199605763,"@ChokolateLatte @userunknown200 @Minghowriter Yep! Simple maths. 
No masks at all = 100% chance of viral load.
1 mask being worn = 50% chance of viral load.
2 masks being worn = near 0% chance of viral load.
Combine with washing hands, opening windows, social distancing, &amp; isolation when ill, then the chances are negligible."
